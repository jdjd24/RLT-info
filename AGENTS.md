# AGENTS.md — Red Light Therapy Project

## Project Purpose
This site is a credible, evidence‑led resource on red light therapy. It is not a shop. It should read like a clean, premium health-tech journal with practical tools and reviews.

## Voice and Tone
- Calm, precise, and confident. Senior health/tech journalist tone.
- Avoid hype, buzzwords, and influencer language.
- Write for smart readers: rigorous but readable.
- Explain terms once, then use them consistently.
- No medical promises. Educational only.

## Editorial Standards
- Keep claims proportional to evidence.
- If data is missing or ambiguous, state that plainly.
- Prefer primary sources and high‑quality reviews.
- Avoid internal references, file names, or process notes in public copy.

## Visual and UX Direction
- High-end, minimalist, modern. White/black base with restrained red accents.
- Strong typography hierarchy and generous spacing.
- Clean tables and consistent cards. No gimmicky UI elements.
- Navigation should be simple and scannable with clear anchors.

## Section Guidelines
- Home: minimal, aesthetic, clear entry points to key sections.
- Benefits: blog‑style, evidence‑aware, with a concise summary table.
- Dose Science: deeper, practical, explains biphasic response and implications.
- Reviews: consistent cards; one product per brand unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- Thought Leaders: brief, factual, sourced, with high‑quality headshots.

## Working Rules
- Do not include internal notes, prompts, or process text in user‑facing pages.
- Avoid "placeholder" or "auto-refreshed" wording in public UI.
- If a claim is not defensible, flag it and ask before publishing.
