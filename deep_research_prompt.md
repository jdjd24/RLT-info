You are tasked with conducting a systematic, up‑to‑date literature review of peer‑reviewed human studies on photobiomodulation (PBM) published in the last 5 years. Your goal is to extract precise protocol parameters and outcomes for the following indications: skin rejuvenation, wound healing, joint pain, muscle recovery, and whole‑body wellness.

For each study you find, provide:
- **Full citation** (authors, year, journal, DOI or PubMed link)
- **Indication** (one of the five categories above)
- **Wavelength(s)** used (nm, and whether Red, NIR, or combined)
- **Irradiance** (mW/cm²) and **distance** (cm or inches) at which it was measured
- **Dose (J/cm²)** per session
- **Frequency** (sessions per week) and **total duration** (weeks or number of sessions)
- **Session time** as calculated (seconds or minutes)
- **Measured outcomes** (e.g. % collagen increase, VAS pain reduction, CK change) and key **biomarkers** tracked (e.g. IL‑6, TNF‑α, cortisol)
- **Study design & size** (RCT, crossover, n=…)
- **Quality assessment**: rate each study 1–10 based on sample size, controls, objective measures, and journal impact
- **Biphasic observations**, if the study reports any rise‑and‑fall or inhibitory trends at higher doses

Organize your findings into a structured JSON array, where each object contains all the fields above. At the end, summarize gaps in the evidence and emerging trends that could inform new app protocols.
