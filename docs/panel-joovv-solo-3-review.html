<section class="section article-prose"><p class="eyebrow">Panels · Full review</p><h1>Joovv Solo 3.0</h1>
<p><strong>The premium starter panel that is actually built to scale</strong></p>
<p>The Solo 3.0 is Joovv's core panel for people who want a serious setup, but do not want to commit to a room-sized monster on day one. It's tall enough to feel useful for legs, back, and torso, and the whole product is clearly designed around one idea: buy one now, and if you love it, stack more later.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is what you are buying with Joovv: a clean industrial build, an accessory ecosystem (mounts, stands, multi-panel expansion), and software-driven modes that make it feel more device-like than most panels. That matters because the boring part of red light therapy is not standing in front of LEDs, it is making the setup painless enough that you keep doing it. Joovv's hardware and mounting options push you in that direction.</p>
<p>Wavelength-wise, it's the classic two-wavelength approach: <strong>660 nm red + 850 nm near-infrared</strong>, split across <strong>150 LEDs</strong>. That is not exciting, but it is defensible. These are the workhorse wavelengths used across the category, and for most people the bigger driver of outcomes is whether you can execute a routine consistently, at sensible distances, without turning your life into a measuring exercise.</p>
<p>Where the Solo 3.0 becomes a very Joovv product is the modes. Some features and modes rely on the mobile app (including things like Recovery+ and Ambient). If you love app control, great. If you want a panel that behaves like a toaster with one button, this is not that vibe.</p>
<p>Coverage is the main trade-off. At roughly <strong>36 in tall and 8.75 in wide</strong>, it's inherently a one-zone-at-a-time panel unless you step back or you plan to expand to a multi-panel layout. You can do full-body routines with a Solo, but you will reposition. That is normal, but it's worth being honest about it.</p>
<p>Joovv talks a lot about measurement methodology and has published comparisons that cite an average irradiance figure for the Solo at 6 inches. The practical takeaway is simple: it's plenty strong for normal home use, but like all brands, you should treat any single-number power claim as a rough planning input, not gospel.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want a premium, modular panel they can start with now and expand into a multi-panel setup later.</p>
<p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Two-wavelength only, and the app-driven extras are a plus for some people and an annoyance for others. Returns are not free and frictionless once you read the fine print (return shipping and some costs may be on you).</p>
