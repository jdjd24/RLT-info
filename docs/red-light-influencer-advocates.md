Here’s a list of *well-known health, wellness, and fitness figures* who have publicly advocated, discussed, or used red light therapy, along with the specific **devices or types of red light tools** they’ve referenced in their content or routines (note that advocacy can range from casual mention to explicit endorsement): ([RedLight Innovation][1])

### Key Influencers and Advocates

1. **Joe Rogan (Podcaster, Wellness Enthusiast)**
   *Advocacy*: Frequently discusses red light therapy benefits (muscle recovery, inflammation, better sleep) on *The Joe Rogan Experience* and in wellness interviews.
   *Devices Used/Referenced*:
   • **Joovv Red Light Therapy** full-body and panel systems (brand he’s publicly connected to). ([Joovv][2])

2. **Dr. Rhonda Patrick (Biomedical Science Educator)**
   *Advocacy*: Cites research on photobiomodulation and red/near-infrared light; she has recommended specific LED light therapy products in her independent reviews.
   *Devices Used/Referenced*:
   • **iRestore Illumina Face Mask** (LED + near-infrared face panel she has noted as fitting clinical light parameters).
   • Previously used **Omnilux Contour Face** (before switching due to eye comfort). ([Fast Life Hacks][3])

3. **Celebrities Who Have Shared Usage Publicly**
   Some public figures have spoken about incorporating red-light devices into personal routines (mainly skincare or wellness moments):
   • **Miranda Kerr** – mentioned using a red light therapy *full-body light mat* for skin and recovery. ([New York Post][4])
   • **Katy Perry** – uses the **Solawave Radiant Renewal 4-in-1 Skincare Wand**, a compact red light tool for skin prep. ([People.com][5])
   • **Kim Kardashian** – big fan of at-home LED red light masks (gifting and using brands like CurrentBody & Omnilux). ([Marie Claire][6])
   • **Nicole Kidman** and **Tate McRae** have been reported using the **Solawave 4-in-1 Wand** in skincare routines. ([InStyle][7])

   • **Erling Haaland (Athlete)** – reported buying a *£15,000 red-light therapy bed* for muscle recovery (not a formal endorsement, but a documented personal use). ([The Scottish Sun][8])

### Common Devices Referenced in Advocacy

These are among the most frequently mentioned consumer/home tools in the influencer space:

* **Joovv Panels / Systems** – widely cited by Rogan and many biohackers for full-body red + near-infrared use. ([Joovv][2])
* **iRestore Illumina Face Mask** – Dr. Patrick’s current noted preference for robust LED wavelengths with eye protection. ([Fast Life Hacks][3])
* **Solawave Radiant Renewal 4-in-1 Wand** – popular handheld skincare device seen with multiple celebrity users. ([People.com][5])
* **Omnilux LED Masks** – classic panel model featured by influencers (also historically used by Dr. Patrick before switching). ([Fast Life Hacks][3])
* **CurrentBody LED Masks** – documented in celebrity routines (e.g. Kim Kardashian). ([Marie Claire][6])

### Notes on Context and Evidence

* Much of the *public advocacy and influencer use* of red light therapy is rooted in personal experience and interpretation of emerging science, not large-scale clinical consensus. Clinicians emphasize there is *some evidence* for benefits like collagen stimulation and muscle recovery, but effects vary with **wavelength, irradiance, exposure time, and device quality**. ([sciencebasedmedicine.org][9])
* Devices vary from **medical-grade, high-irradiance panels** to smaller **beauty-focused LED tools**, and not all deliver the same therapeutic light doses.

If you want, I can break this down further into a structured table with typical wavelengths, irradiance, and approximate price ranges for each device.
