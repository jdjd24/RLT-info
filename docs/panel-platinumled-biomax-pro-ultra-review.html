      <h1>PlatinumLED BioMax Pro Ultra</h1>
      <p><strong>The configure-it-once powerhouse, with real controls that actually change how you use a panel</strong></p>
      <p>The BioMax Pro Ultra is built around a simple promise: shorter sessions, more control, fewer compromises. It's a high-output panel, but the more important upgrade is how much control you get over what that output looks like in real life.</p>
      <p>Most panels force you into a single blend and you just live with it. Here, you can adjust each wavelength individually, save your own profiles, and use preset smart modes when you do not feel like thinking. That matters because the best panel is the one that fits the way you actually use it: calmer sessions at night, brighter sessions post-training, and more targeted sessions when you're chasing a specific goal. PlatinumLED explicitly positions the Pro line around individual wavelength control, pulse control, smart modes, and higher output.</p>
      <p>If you're building a multi-panel setup, the zero-gap design is one of those details that sounds like marketing until you actually try to stand in front of two panels and realize the dead zone is annoying. The Pro series is designed to minimize that gap when you pair units.</p>
      <p>Where you pay for all this is obvious: price, and the fact that returns are not free-trial, no-questions-asked in practice. Yes, they have a 60-day satisfaction window, but elective returns carry a 20% restocking fee and you cover return shipping. That changes the decision psychology, so it's worth knowing up front. Warranty is 3 years.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want a top-tier panel with real session control (per-wavelength adjustment, pulse, presets), especially if they expect to build a multi-panel setup later.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Expensive, and the return policy has real friction (20% restocking fee + you pay return shipping). Warranty is solid, but not industry-leading length.</p>
