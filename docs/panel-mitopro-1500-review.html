      <h1>MitoPRO 1500+</h1>
      <p><strong>The rare panel that gets the basics right without overcomplicating things</strong></p>
      <p>The MitoPRO 1500+ sits in a sweet spot that's surprisingly hard to hit in this category. It's big enough that full-body sessions feel realistic rather than theoretical, powerful enough that you're not standing there forever, and priced in a way that doesn't make you feel like you're paying a "tech lifestyle" tax.</p>
      <p>In day-to-day use, what stands out is how straightforward it is. There's no app to fight with, no maze of modes to remember, and no sense that you're paying for features you'll stop using after the first week. You turn it on, you stand in front of it, you're done. That simplicity makes it much easier to stick with over months, which is where any red light setup either proves its worth or quietly gathers dust.</p>
      <p>The width and height put it into what most people would call "mostly full-body" territory. You'll still reposition for complete coverage, but not nearly as much as with narrower panels. For many home setups, this is about the largest single panel you can fit without turning a room into a clinic.</p>
      <p>Value is where the MitoPRO 1500+ really makes its case. At around $1,169, you're getting a lot of physical coverage for the money, and that matters more than small differences in headline output numbers. There are more powerful panels, and there are prettier ones, but few that make this much practical sense per dollar spent.</p>
      <p>The main caveat is the same one that applies to most of this category: you're relying on manufacturer-provided output data rather than independent, full-field measurements. In real-world terms, that's unlikely to be a deal-breaker, but it's worth keeping expectations grounded. This is a workhorse panel, not a lab instrument.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want one big, no-nonsense panel that makes full-body routines practical at home.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> It's physically large, and like most panels, output figures are based on manufacturer testing rather than independent mapping.</p>
