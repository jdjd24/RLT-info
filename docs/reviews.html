            <h3>What matters when choosing a panel</h3>
            <p>These are the practical variables that actually drive outcomes and adherence: power, price and value, EMF transparency, dosing controls, modularity, and body coverage.</p>
            <table class="data-table">
              <thead>
                <tr>

                  <td>Power determines how long each session takes and whether enough light reaches your skin to match the doses used in studies. What matters is not the big "wattage" number in adverts, but how much light reaches your body at the distance you actually stand or sit from the device. More usable power usually means shorter, more practical sessions.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Price / Value</strong></td>
                  <td>Value is not about finding the cheapest device. It is about how much useful coverage and real-world performance you get for the money. A cheaper device that takes twice as long to use, or only covers a small area, often ends up costing more in time and frustration.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>EMF transparency</strong></td>
                  <td>These devices are used close to the body, often several times a week. Clear, specific testing helps separate careful engineering from vague marketing. "Low EMF" without numbers or test methods does not tell you much about what you are actually exposed to.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Features</strong></td>
                  <td>Features matter because they shape how easy and pleasant a device is to use day to day. Built-in timers, clear red vs near-infrared selection, pulsing modes, presets, or app control can all make routines simpler or more enjoyable, depending on what you value. Some features genuinely help with consistency and ease of use, while others are more about convenience or preference. The important point is whether the feature set fits how you actually plan to use the device, not how impressive it looks on a spec sheet.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Modularity</strong></td>
                  <td>Some people start small and expand over time. A modular system lets you add coverage later instead of replacing everything you already own, which can make a more expensive brand cheaper in the long run.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Body coverage</strong></td>
                  <td>Coverage affects whether the device fits into real life. Small panels turn full-body routines into long, fiddly sessions with lots of repositioning. Bigger coverage makes it easier to finish a session and stick with the routine over weeks and months.</td>

            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> The MitoPRO 1500+ gets the fundamentals right in a way very few panels do. It is wide and tall enough that full-body routines feel realistic, powerful enough that sessions do not drag on, and priced fairly for the amount of coverage you get. There is no app or feature bloat here, but that is part of the appeal: it is easy to use, easy to stick with, and easy to recommend. If you want one panel to anchor a home setup without overthinking it, this is the cleanest choice.</p>

It does not top the charts for output, and it is not a bargain pick, but it is well thought-out, pleasant to use, and backed by one of the strongest warranty packages in the category. Over months of use, that low-friction ownership experience often matters more than chasing peak numbers. A very safe, very sensible buy.</p>

            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> The Hooga PRO1500 focuses on doing the basics well: clear output claims, simple controls, and a sensible price for its size. It is narrower than the top two, so you will spend a bit more time repositioning during sessions, but it is also easier to place in a normal room. It does not feel premium or especially clever, but it is predictable and easy to live with, which counts for a lot in a daily-use device.</p>

            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> If you enjoy tweaking modes, using presets, and experimenting with different session styles, the Refine 900 is one of the more interesting panels to own. You get a lot of features for the money, and the interface feels more modern than most. The trade-off is lower output, which means longer sessions if you are chasing the same dose as higher-power panels. Great for tinkerers, less ideal for anyone who just wants to get in and out quickly.</p>

            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> This is the panel you buy when intensity is the priority. It is built for shorter sessions or for treating comfortably from further away, and in that role it does exactly what it promises. The experience is more utilitarian than refined, and the price is firmly in premium territory, so the value only really makes sense if you actually need that extra output. For everyone else, it is impressive but hard to justify.</p>

It is flexible, configurable, and clearly designed for people who like to experiment. The downside is speed: lower reported output means longer sessions, and at this price that is a real trade-off. Best seen as a niche choice for people who value control over efficiency.</p>

The build quality is high, the app experience is smooth, and the modular ecosystem is well thought out. The problem is that on its own, it is very expensive for the amount of coverage you get, and you will spend more time repositioning than with cheaper, wider panels. It makes sense as a starting point for a larger Joovv system, but as a standalone buy, it is hard to recommend on value.</p>

            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> Best choice if you want an all-in-one face gadget. Interesting if you care about features as well as light therapy, but less focused on core LED benefits. Higher price and heavier fit reduce overall value for pure light therapy.</p>
