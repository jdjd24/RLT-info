            <h3>What matters when choosing a panel</h3>
            <p>These are the variables that drive real-world value for most buyers: usable power at your working distance, coverage, wavelength mix, price, and the small usability features that keep sessions repeatable.</p>

                  <td><strong>Power</strong></td>
                  <td>Power determines session length at the distance you actually use. Ignore wattage marketing. What matters is usable light at your working distance and how evenly it is delivered.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Price / Value</strong></td>
                  <td>Value is coverage, usable power, wavelength mix, build, features, and support terms for the price. Cheap panels can be false economy if they are slow, awkward, or costly to return.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>EMF transparency</strong></td>
                  <td>These devices are used close to the body, often several times a week. Clear, specific testing helps separate careful engineering from vague marketing. "Low EMF" without numbers or test methods does not tell you much about what you are actually exposed to.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Features</strong></td>
                  <td>Features only matter if they make sessions repeatable: timers, dimming, pulsing, presets, and simple controls. Spec-sheet complexity rarely improves outcomes.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Modularity</strong></td>
                  <td>Some people start small and expand over time. A modular system lets you add coverage later instead of replacing everything you already own, which can make a more expensive brand cheaper in the long run.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Body coverage</strong></td>
                  <td>Coverage affects whether the device fits into real life. Small panels turn full-body routines into long, fiddly sessions with lots of repositioning. Bigger coverage makes it easier to finish a session and stick with the routine over weeks and months.</td>

            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> The MitoPRO 1500+ gets the fundamentals right in a way very few panels do. It is wide and tall enough that full-body routines feel realistic, powerful enough that sessions do not drag on, and priced fairly for the amount of coverage you get. There is no app or feature bloat here, but that is part of the appeal: it is easy to use, easy to stick with, and easy to recommend. If you want one panel to anchor a home setup without overthinking it, this is the cleanest choice.</p>

It is not the strongest value-output play, but it is easy to operate, easy to live with, and consistently pleasant in regular use.

            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> The Hooga PRO1500 is an output-first buy: high usable power for the money, straightforward controls, and a predictable routine. It is narrower than wider premium panels, so you will reposition more during longer routines, but it remains easy to place and easy to run. This is less about polish and more about getting a lot of light for the price.</p>

            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> If you enjoy tweaking modes, using presets, and experimenting with different session styles, the Refine 900 is one of the more interesting panels to own. You get a lot of features for the money, and the interface feels more modern than most. The trade-off is lower output, which means longer sessions if you are chasing the same dose as higher-power panels. Great for tinkerers, less ideal for anyone who just wants to get in and out quickly.</p>

            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> This is the panel you buy when intensity is the priority. It is built for shorter sessions or for treating comfortably from further away, and in that role it does exactly what it promises. The experience is more utilitarian than refined, and the price is firmly in premium territory, so the value only really makes sense if you actually need that extra output. For everyone else, it is impressive but hard to justify.</p>

It is flexible, configurable, and clearly designed for people who like to experiment. The downside is speed: lower reported output means longer sessions, and at this price that is a real trade-off. Best seen as a niche choice for people who value control over efficiency.</p>

The build quality is high, the app experience is smooth, and the modular ecosystem is well thought out. The problem is that on its own, it is very expensive for the amount of coverage you get, and you will spend more time repositioning than with cheaper, wider panels. It makes sense as a starting point for a larger Joovv system, but as a standalone buy, it is hard to recommend on value.</p>

            <p class="rank-sub">Multi-wavelength mask with vibration for a more treatment-like session</p>
            <p class="muted"><strong>Review:</strong> Best if you want an all-in-one face gadget. The vibration makes sessions feel more like a short treatment, and the multi-mode approach is convenient if you are balancing several concerns. Higher price and heavier fit mean it makes most sense for people who actually want the vibration feature, not just LED.</p>
