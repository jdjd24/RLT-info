      <h1>Rojo Refine 900</h1>
      <p><strong>The "control freak" panel, in the best way: five wavelengths, an app, and a stand included</strong></p>
      <p>If you've ever looked at red light panels and thought "why can't I just turn up the one wavelength I actually care about", the Refine 900 is basically built for you. Its headline feature is unusually practical: <strong>independent control of each wavelength</strong> (630/660/810/830/850), so you can run a red-heavy session for skin, or bias toward 810nm for deeper-target routines, without being forced into a fixed blend. That is rare.</p>

      <h2>Short verdict</h2>
      <p>This is a feature-forward body panel that still behaves like a normal household device. You get a <strong>touchscreen</strong>, a <strong>phone app</strong>, <strong>preset and smart modes</strong>, and <strong>pulsing (NIR)</strong> if you want it. It also ships with a <strong>wheeled floor stand included</strong>, which matters more than people think because anything annoying to position gets used less.</p>

      <h2>What it's like to own</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Control that actually changes your routine:</strong> Most panels give you a couple of wavelengths and a power button. The Rojo's per-wavelength sliders mean you can keep the session length stable and change what you are doing, rather than buying a whole second device for a different mix.</li>
        <li><strong>App plus touchscreen is the right pairing:</strong> Touchscreen is good when you are right next to it. The app is what makes it workable if the panel is on a stand behind you, above you, or slightly out of reach.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical size:</strong> The Refine 900 is commonly described around the serious home panel size, about <strong>36 inches tall and 12 inches wide</strong>, with <strong>300 dual-chip LEDs</strong>, which is big enough to feel like you are doing a body session rather than a tiny spot treatment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Support, warranty, and returns</h2>
      <p>This is one of the calmer purchases in the category because Rojo leans into try-it-at-home terms: <strong>3-year warranty</strong> and a <strong>60-day return window</strong> are consistently stated across their docs and regional sites.</p>
      <p>Why this matters: panels are bulky, and early buyer's remorse is usually about fit in your space and routine, not the LEDs. A real return window is what lets you learn that without feeling trapped.</p>

      <h2>Price snapshot</h2>
      <p>Pricing varies by region and promos, but you will commonly see it discussed around the <strong>low-to-mid $1,000s USD</strong>, often with the stand bundled.</p>
      <p>The way to think about value here is not cheapest watts, it's how many future use-cases this panel covers without needing an upgrade.</p>

      <h2>Best for</h2>
      <p>People who want one panel that can flex with them: skin one month, training recovery the next, then mostly NIR because you read something interesting and want to try it.</p>

      <h2>Watch-outs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smart modes are not magic.</strong> They are convenient, but dosing protocols are still a moving target in this category, so treat them as guided presets, not medical programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency is better than average, not perfect.</strong> You get clear wavelength intent and strong documentation, but like most consumer panels you are still relying on manufacturer-stated performance rather than a full independent field map.</li>
      </ul>
