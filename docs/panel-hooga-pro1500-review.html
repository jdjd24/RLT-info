<section class="section article-prose"><p class="eyebrow">Panels · Full review</p><h1>Hooga PRO1500</h1>
<p><strong>A straightforward panel that focuses on the basics and little else</strong></p>
<p>The Hooga PRO1500 feels deliberately uncomplicated. It's built around a simple idea: deliver a decent amount of light, tell you what that looks like at real distances, and don't bury the user in features they'll never touch.</p>
<p>In use, the first thing you notice is the narrower shape compared with wider panels in this class. That means you'll spend a bit more time repositioning to cover larger areas, especially if you're aiming for something close to full-body sessions.</p>
<p>The controls are basic and the experience is utilitarian. There's nothing here that feels luxurious, but nothing that feels flimsy either. It does what it says on the box, and it does it in a predictable way.</p>
<p>At around $1,199, the pricing feels fair for the size and output you're getting. You're paying for a solid, mid-market panel that covers the essentials and stays out of your way.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want clear, no-nonsense performance claims and simple, repeatable daily use.</p>
<p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Narrower coverage means more repositioning, and it's light on extra features.</p>
