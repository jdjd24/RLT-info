<section class="section article-prose"><p class="eyebrow">Masks · Full review</p><h1>CurrentBody Skin LED Mask Series 2</h1>
<p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $500-$550</p><p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want full-face coverage with red + near-infrared + deep near-infrared in one comfortable, flexible mask.</p><p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> You pay a premium, and there is still no real dose-at-skin transparency.</p>
<h2>Short verdict</h2>
<p>One of the most complete consumer LED masks you can buy, mainly because it combines wide facial coverage with three useful wavelengths in a flexible, easy-to-wear design. The fit makes daily sessions feel realistic rather than aspirational, which is half the battle with any face device. It is not cheap, but compared with simpler two-wavelength masks, you are paying for comfort, coverage, and a more future-proof setup.</p>
<h2>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h2>
<p>The flexible silicone shell sits close to the face and wraps under the chin, which gives it better real-world coverage than many rigid masks. Pressure points are minimal, and the eye guards do a good job of blocking glare. Because it is comfortable enough to wear for the full session, it is easier to stick with consistently.</p>
<h2>Routine and usability</h2>
<p>Sessions are short and predictable at around 10 minutes. Controls are simple, and there is not much to fiddle with, which helps keep it a put-it-on-and-get-it-done habit.</p>
<h2>What you get for the money</h2>
<p>At $500-$550, this is firmly in the mid-premium bracket. The value comes from coverage, comfort, and the three-wavelength setup rather than raw power claims.</p>
