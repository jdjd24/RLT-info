<p><strong>A thoughtful upgrade that focuses on fit, coverage and the wavelengths that actually matter</strong></p>
<p>The market for at-home LED face masks is crowded and, frankly, a bit noisy. Most products promise dramatic results, quote selective bits of science and then rely on habit and hope to do the rest. The CurrentBody Series 2 takes a quieter approach. It does not try to reinvent LED therapy. Instead, it refines the parts that usually decide whether a device gets used or ends up in a drawer.</p>
<p>If you have ever owned a mask that felt impressive for a week and then slowly disappeared from your routine, this one feels designed to avoid that fate.</p>
<h2>What it actually does</h2>
<p>At its core, this is a red and near-infrared LED mask built around <strong>633 nm</strong> and <strong>830 nm</strong>. Those are not fashionable choices. They are simply the wavelengths with the longest and most consistent track record in human skin studies.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of decades, these bands have been studied for things like improving skin texture, softening fine lines, helping with post-procedure healing and reducing inflammation and redness. The effects are not miraculous and they are not instant, but there is enough clinical work behind them to say they are sensible choices rather than marketing inventions.</p>
<p>Series 2 also adds a third wavelength, <strong>1072 nm</strong>, placed around the eyes and mouth. The evidence here is thinner, but promising enough to make this a reasonable bonus rather than a gimmick. It is best thought of as an extra layer, not the main reason to buy the mask.</p>
<h2>What's actually new, and why it matters</h2>
<p><strong>Better coverage under the chin</strong><br />Most flexible masks stop at the jawline. This one does not. The added chin strap means the under-chin and jaw area finally get direct light, which is relevant both for skin firmness and for people who tend to get breakouts along that line.</p>
<p><strong>A softer, better-fitting shell</strong><br />The switch to poured silicone sounds like a technical detail, but it shows up in comfort. The mask sits more naturally on the face and is less prone to digging in around the nose or cheeks. Comfort matters, because comfort is what makes people keep using these things.</p>
<p><strong>More attention to LED quality and verification</strong><br />CurrentBody has tightened the tolerance around the wavelengths and added a traceability system that lets you check what the device is supposed to be delivering. In a category where specs are often vague or selectively presented, this kind of transparency is genuinely welcome.</p>
<p><strong>A redesigned battery</strong><br />The battery is now integrated and clips onto clothing. You get roughly ten sessions per charge. The downside is that the mask no longer lies completely flat, which makes storage and travel a little less tidy.</p>
<h2>What using it is like</h2>
<p>There is no app, no pulsing modes and no menu of settings. You put it on, run a ten-minute session and take it off. For many people, that simplicity will be a relief. For others, it may feel a bit bare-bones.</p>
<p>The reported power level, around <strong>30 mW/cm2</strong>, is in line with other masks aimed at skin rather than deep tissue. That means you should think in terms of gradual, cumulative changes over weeks and months, not dramatic shifts in a few days.</p>
<p>It is also a bright mask. If you are sensitive to light, you will probably want to use the optional eye inserts. They reduce the brightness, though they do not block it completely.</p>
<h2>The small frustrations</h2>
<p>The mask does not store as neatly as flatter designs, because of the battery shape. If you like to keep things tucked away in a slim drawer or pack light when travelling, you will notice this.</p>
<p>Forehead coverage is fine, but not generous. That is true of most flexible masks, but if you have a larger forehead, you may wish it reached a little higher.</p>
<h2>Who it makes sense for</h2>
<p>This is a good choice if you want a <strong>well-built, evidence-aligned</strong> LED mask that is comfortable enough to use regularly and covers more of the face and jawline than most alternatives.</p>
<p>It is less ideal if you want smart features, guided sessions, or something that packs completely flat.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>The CurrentBody Series 2 does not promise miracles, and that is part of its appeal. It keeps the wavelengths that make sense, improves the fit and coverage in ways that actually affect day-to-day use, and adds a level of quality control that is rare in this category.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a premium LED mask that feels thoughtfully designed rather than over-marketed, this is one of the stronger options available right now.</p>
