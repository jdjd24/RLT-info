      <h2>CurrentBody Skin LED Mask Series 2</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $500-$550</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want full-face coverage with red + near-infrared + deep near-infrared in one comfortable, flexible mask.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> You pay a premium, and there is still no real dose-at-skin transparency.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>One of the most complete consumer LED masks you can buy, mainly because it combines wide facial coverage with three useful wavelengths in a flexible, easy-to-wear design. The fit makes daily sessions feel realistic rather than aspirational, which is half the battle with any face device. It is not cheap, but compared with simpler two-wavelength masks, you are paying for comfort, coverage, and a more future-proof setup. The main limitation is that, like most masks, you are still working without clear irradiance-at-skin data.</p>
      <h3>What it is trying to do</h3>
      <p>This mask targets skin tone, texture, and signs of ageing using red, near-infrared, and deep near-infrared light. The extra deep near-infrared channel is positioned around areas like the eyes and mouth, where ageing tends to show first. Compared with cheaper masks, the pitch here is broader coverage and a more complete wavelength mix rather than just "red light only".</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h3>
      <p>The flexible silicone shell sits close to the face and wraps under the chin, which gives it better real-world coverage than many rigid masks. Pressure points are minimal, and the eye guards do a good job of blocking glare. Because it is comfortable enough to wear for the full session, it is easier to stick with consistently.</p>
      <h3>Routine and usability</h3>
      <p>Sessions are short and predictable at around 10 minutes. Controls are simple, and there is not much to fiddle with, which helps keep it a "put it on and get it done" habit. There is no fancy interface or countdown screen, but the routine is easy to repeat day after day.</p>
      <h3>Light modes and what they are for</h3>
      <p>You get red and near-infrared for general skin tone, texture, and support of collagen-related processes, plus deep near-infrared aimed at slightly deeper tissue. There is no blue mode here, so this is more of an anti-ageing and skin-quality mask than an acne-focused one.</p>
      <h3>What you get for the money</h3>
      <p>At $500-$550, this is firmly in the mid-premium bracket. The value comes from coverage, comfort, and the three-wavelength setup rather than raw power claims. If you just want basic red light, cheaper masks exist. If you want something you are actually likely to use for months, the price makes more sense.</p>
      <h3>Fine print</h3>
      <p>An FDA 510(k) listing exists. Like most masks, there is no published irradiance-at-skin map, so dosing precision is limited.</p>

      <h2>Omnilux Contour Face</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $395-$450</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want a comfortable, simple mask they can use consistently without overthinking specs.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> Output and wavelength details are thin, so you are buying usability more than data transparency.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>This is a comfort-first mask that focuses on making daily use easy rather than chasing headline specs. The flexible fit and predictable 10-minute sessions make it one of the easier masks to live with long term. It is priced in the middle of the category and feels fair if your priority is routine adherence rather than technical detail. The trade-off is limited transparency around output and wavelengths.</p>
      <h3>What it is trying to do</h3>
      <p>The Contour Face is aimed at general skin quality and anti-ageing routines using red and near-infrared light. It does not try to be a multi-mode, multi-problem device. Instead, it focuses on delivering a simple, repeatable routine with a comfortable fit.</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h3>
      <p>The flexible silicone design sits comfortably on the face and holds its position well. Coverage is good across the main facial areas, and pressure points are minimal. This is one of its strongest points: it is easy to forget you are wearing it after a minute or two.</p>
      <h3>Routine and usability</h3>
      <p>Sessions run at about 10 minutes, and the controls are straightforward. There is no complexity here, which is exactly the appeal. You are unlikely to skip sessions because it feels like a hassle.</p>
      <h3>Light modes and what they are for</h3>
      <p>This is a red and near-infrared mask aimed at general skin tone and texture rather than acne-specific routines. There is no blue mode and no complex program selection, which keeps things simple but limits versatility.</p>
      <h3>What you get for the money</h3>
      <p>At around $395-$450, this sits in a reasonable middle ground. You are paying for comfort, fit, and ease of use rather than extra wavelengths or advanced controls. If you value a mask you will actually use, the price makes sense. If you want maximum technical features, other options offer more on paper.</p>
      <h3>Fine print</h3>
      <p>Marketed as FDA cleared. Like most masks in this category, detailed irradiance-at-skin data is not published.</p>

      <h2>DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro (Dr Dennis Gross)</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $455</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want very short, structured sessions and both red and blue light in one device.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> The fit is rigid, and output transparency is limited.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>The big appeal here is time: sessions are extremely short, which makes this one of the easiest masks to turn into a daily habit. The combination of red and blue light is useful if you are balancing skin ageing and breakouts. At around $455, it is not cheap, but the low time commitment is a real practical advantage. The downsides are a rigid shell and the usual lack of clear dose-at-skin data.</p>
      <h3>What it is trying to do</h3>
      <p>This mask combines red light for general skin quality and blue light for acne-prone skin, packaged into very short, automated sessions. It is positioned as a structured, no-thinking-required routine device rather than a customizable tool.</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h3>
      <p>The rigid shell does not adapt to face shape as well as flexible silicone masks, which can lead to small gaps or pressure points for some users. Coverage is still good across the main facial areas, but comfort is more "acceptable" than "forget you are wearing it".</p>
      <h3>Routine and usability</h3>
      <p>This is where it shines. Sessions are around three minutes with automatic shutoff, which removes almost all friction from daily use. Controls are simple, and there is very little setup each time.</p>
      <h3>Light modes and what they are for</h3>
      <p>You get red light for skin tone and texture and blue light for acne-focused routines. This makes it more versatile than red-only masks, especially for people dealing with breakouts alongside anti-ageing goals.</p>
      <h3>What you get for the money</h3>
      <p>At about $455, you are paying for convenience and dual-mode capability rather than comfort or data transparency. If time is your main barrier to consistency, the value proposition is strong. If comfort and fit matter more, other masks do better.</p>
      <h3>Fine print</h3>
      <p>Marketed as FDA cleared. No published irradiance or uniformity maps, which makes precise dose comparisons difficult.</p>

      <h2>TheraFace Mask (Therabody)</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $599-$699</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want an all-in-one face device combining LED with vibration and massage.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> You are paying for features more than better light performance.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>This is the most feature-heavy mask in the group, combining LED light with vibration and other modalities. If you like the idea of a single device doing multiple things, the price can make sense. If your goal is purely LED therapy, it is hard to justify the premium, because the extra features do not clearly translate into better light delivery. Think of this as a skincare gadget first and a light device second.</p>
      <h3>What it is trying to do</h3>
      <p>The TheraFace Mask aims to be a multi-purpose facial treatment tool, mixing red, near-infrared, and blue light with vibration and massage features. It is designed for people who want a broader "treatment experience" rather than a single-purpose LED routine.</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h3>
      <p>The rigid shell and added hardware make it heavier than silicone masks. Fit is decent, but you are more aware you are wearing it, especially during longer or multi-mode sessions. Coverage across the face is still good.</p>
      <h3>Routine and usability</h3>
      <p>There are more modes and options here, which means more button-pressing and more decisions before each session. That is fine if you enjoy tinkering, but it is less "throw it on and go" than simpler masks.</p>
      <h3>Light modes and what they are for</h3>
      <p>You get red, near-infrared, and blue modes, covering both general skin quality and acne-focused use. The vibration and massage features are about comfort and experience rather than proven improvements in light therapy outcomes.</p>
      <h3>What you get for the money</h3>
      <p>At $599-$699, this is one of the most expensive options in the category. The price makes sense if you want an all-in-one facial device. If you are mainly buying it for LED therapy, you are paying extra for features that do not clearly improve light results.</p>
      <h3>Fine print</h3>
      <p>An FDA listing exists. As with most masks, there is no detailed irradiance-at-skin data published.</p>
