      <h2>CurrentBody Series 2 LED Mask review</h2>
      <p><strong>A thoughtful upgrade that focuses on fit, coverage and the wavelengths that actually matter</strong></p>
      <p>The market for at-home LED face masks is crowded and, frankly, a bit noisy. Most products promise dramatic results, quote selective bits of science and then rely on habit and hope to do the rest. The CurrentBody Series 2 takes a quieter approach. It does not try to reinvent LED therapy. Instead, it refines the parts that usually decide whether a device gets used or ends up in a drawer.</p>
      <p>If you have ever owned a mask that felt impressive for a week and then slowly disappeared from your routine, this one feels designed to avoid that fate.</p>
      <h3>What it actually does</h3>
      <p>At its core, this is a red and near-infrared LED mask built around <strong>633 nm</strong> and <strong>830 nm</strong>. Those are not fashionable choices. They are simply the wavelengths with the longest and most consistent track record in human skin studies.</p>
      <p>Over the past couple of decades, these bands have been studied for things like improving skin texture, softening fine lines, helping with post-procedure healing and reducing inflammation and redness. The effects are not miraculous and they are not instant, but there is enough clinical work behind them to say they are sensible choices rather than marketing inventions.</p>
      <p>Series 2 also adds a third wavelength, <strong>1072 nm</strong>, placed around the eyes and mouth. The evidence here is thinner, but promising enough to make this a reasonable bonus rather than a gimmick. It is best thought of as an extra layer, not the main reason to buy the mask.</p>
      <h3>What's actually new, and why it matters</h3>
      <p><strong>Better coverage under the chin</strong><br />Most flexible masks stop at the jawline. This one does not. The added chin strap means the under-chin and jaw area finally get direct light, which is relevant both for skin firmness and for people who tend to get breakouts along that line.</p>
      <p><strong>A softer, better-fitting shell</strong><br />The switch to poured silicone sounds like a technical detail, but it shows up in comfort. The mask sits more naturally on the face and is less prone to digging in around the nose or cheeks. Comfort matters, because comfort is what makes people keep using these things.</p>
      <p><strong>More attention to LED quality and verification</strong><br />CurrentBody has tightened the tolerance around the wavelengths and added a traceability system that lets you check what the device is supposed to be delivering. In a category where specs are often vague or selectively presented, this kind of transparency is genuinely welcome.</p>
      <p><strong>A redesigned battery</strong><br />The battery is now integrated and clips onto clothing. You get roughly ten sessions per charge. The downside is that the mask no longer lies completely flat, which makes storage and travel a little less tidy.</p>
      <h3>What using it is like</h3>
      <p>There is no app, no pulsing modes and no menu of settings. You put it on, run a ten-minute session and take it off. For many people, that simplicity will be a relief. For others, it may feel a bit bare-bones.</p>
      <p>The reported power level, around <strong>30 mW/cm2</strong>, is in line with other masks aimed at skin rather than deep tissue. That means you should think in terms of gradual, cumulative changes over weeks and months, not dramatic shifts in a few days.</p>
      <p>It is also a bright mask. If you are sensitive to light, you will probably want to use the optional eye inserts. They reduce the brightness, though they do not block it completely.</p>
      <h3>The small frustrations</h3>
      <p>The mask does not store as neatly as flatter designs, because of the battery shape. If you like to keep things tucked away in a slim drawer or pack light when travelling, you will notice this.</p>
      <p>Forehead coverage is fine, but not generous. That is true of most flexible masks, but if you have a larger forehead, you may wish it reached a little higher.</p>
      <h3>Who it makes sense for</h3>
      <p>This is a good choice if you want a <strong>well-built, evidence-aligned</strong> LED mask that is comfortable enough to use regularly and covers more of the face and jawline than most alternatives.</p>
      <p>It is less ideal if you want smart features, guided sessions, or something that packs completely flat.</p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>The CurrentBody Series 2 does not promise miracles, and that is part of its appeal. It keeps the wavelengths that make sense, improves the fit and coverage in ways that actually affect day-to-day use, and adds a level of quality control that is rare in this category.</p>
      <p>If you are looking for a premium LED mask that feels thoughtfully designed rather than over-marketed, this is one of the stronger options available right now.</p>

      <h2>Omnilux Contour Face</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $395 to $450</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want a comfortable, low-friction mask they can actually stick with long term.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> You are buying ease of use and comfort more than deep technical transparency.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>The Omnilux Contour Face is not the most technical LED mask on the market, and it does not try to be. Its real strength is that it makes regular use easy. The flexible silicone fit, simple controls and short, predictable sessions mean it slips into a routine without much effort. For many people, that matters more than squeezing out a few extra percentage points of theoretical performance.</p>
      <p>If your main goal is consistency rather than spec-chasing, this is one of the easier masks to live with.</p>
      <h3>What it is, in practical terms</h3>
      <p>This is a red and near-infrared LED face mask built around the two most common skincare wavelengths, roughly 633 nm and 830 nm. Those are the same bands used in a lot of clinic and home devices aimed at skin texture, redness and fine lines.</p>
      <p>You use it for about 10 minutes per session, a few times a week. There is no app, no modes to cycle through, and no decisions to make. You put it on, press the button, and it turns itself off when it is done.</p>
      <p>That simplicity is not accidental. Omnilux has clearly designed this for people who do not want another gadget to manage.</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort and coverage</h3>
      <p>This is where the Omnilux really earns its keep.</p>
      <p>The soft silicone shell molds to the face rather than sitting on top of it, and once the straps are adjusted, it stays put without digging in. Pressure points are minimal, and after a minute or two it is easy to forget you are even wearing it.</p>
      <p>Coverage across the main facial areas is good. Forehead, cheeks, nose and chin all get light, although like most flexible masks it does not reach especially high on the forehead and it does not cover under the chin.</p>
      <p>One thing to be aware of is that there are no eye inserts. The light is bright, and while it is generally safe to close your eyes and relax, people who are very light-sensitive may find this slightly uncomfortable.</p>
      <h3>Routine and day to day use</h3>
      <p>This is a very low-friction device.</p>
      <p>Sessions are short, the controller is simple, and there is no setup beyond strapping it on. The mask switches itself off at the end of the session, which removes one more thing to think about.</p>
      <p>That ease of use is not exciting, but it is exactly what makes devices like this more likely to be used three or four times a week for months rather than three times in the first week and then forgotten.</p>
      <p>If you want something with programmes, pulsing modes or a phone app, this is not that product. If you want something that feels more like brushing your teeth than running a gadget, it is.</p>
      <h3>What it does well, and what it does not</h3>
      <p>The Omnilux Contour Face does a good job at being comfortable, predictable and easy to integrate into daily life. It also uses sensible, well-established wavelengths for facial skin.</p>
      <p>Where it is weaker is on transparency and flexibility. You are not given much detail about output beyond broad claims, and you do not get options to tailor sessions or intensity. In practice, that means you are trusting the manufacturer's choices and focusing on habit rather than optimisation.</p>
      <p>That trade-off will suit some people very well and frustrate others.</p>
      <h3>Who should buy it</h3>
      <p>This mask makes the most sense for someone who wants a <strong>reliable, comfortable, no-fuss</strong> LED routine and knows that consistency is their biggest bottleneck.</p>
      <p>If you are the kind of person who likes to tweak settings, compare numbers and optimise protocols, you will probably find it too basic. If you just want something you will actually use, it is one of the better options in this category.</p>

      <h2>Dr. Dennis Gross DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $455</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want very short, structured sessions and the ability to address both breakouts and signs of aging in one device.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> The rigid fit and limited output transparency mean you are mainly buying convenience and simplicity rather than detailed performance data.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>This mask's strongest selling point is time. With daily sessions of just three minutes that end automatically, it removes most of the friction that stops people sticking with typical LED routines. The combination of red and blue light in one device means you can aim at both acne and general skin health in a single product. If you value ease of use and short, habit-friendly treatment times, this is one of the masks that consistently gets recommended by editors and skincare writers alike. (<a href="https://drdennisgross.com/products/drx-spectralite-faceware-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drdennisgross.com</a>)</p>
      <p>It is not the most flexible or technically transparent design, but it is very easy to fit into a routine.</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort and coverage</h3>
      <p>This mask uses a more rigid shell than the flexible silicone found on some other popular models. That has pros and cons. On the positive side it feels sturdy and precise, and once positioned it stays where it is supposed to. On the downside, it does not mould to every face the way softer masks do, which can leave small gaps around the edges and occasional pressure points for some users. For people with very particular fit preferences, this can be a noticeable drawback.</p>
      <p>Coverage is generally good across the central face, including cheeks, chin and forehead. Because this is a full-mask design, you are less likely to miss zones than you would with smaller panel shapes. The rigid fit does make it feel a bit bulkier than silicone counterparts, but it remains easy to wear during a brief session.</p>
      <h3>Routine and usability</h3>
      <p>This is where the SpectraLite FaceWare Pro excels. Treatment cycles run for about three minutes and shut off automatically at the end. That brevity is not just a talking point. It fundamentally changes how you think about using an LED mask. Instead of needing to plan a 10-minute or longer treatment, you can squeeze this into a morning or evening routine without much effort.</p>
      <p>There are three modes: red light, blue light, and a combination of the two. Red light is generally associated with collagen stimulation, improved skin texture and reduced inflammation, while blue light targets acne-causing bacteria and can help with blemishes. Having both in one device means you can tailor the session to your immediate skin concerns without changing products. (<a href="https://drdennisgross.com/products/drx-spectralite-faceware-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drdennisgross.com</a>)</p>
      <p>The controls are straightforward: power button cycles through modes, mask turns off when the session ends, and the device is designed to be hands-free. This simplicity makes it one of the more approachable masks for people who want results without managing complex settings.</p>
      <h3>What it does well, and what it does not</h3>
      <p>The SpectraLite FaceWare Pro delivers convenience better than almost any other mask at this price point. Three-minute sessions once a day or so feel very manageable, and the mix of red and blue light means you are not locked into one type of treatment. For people struggling with both occasional breakouts and early signs of aging, that versatility is useful.</p>
      <p>Where it is less strong is in transparency and fit. The company provides limited specific output numbers and wavelength details, so you are largely taking their word for how much light is being delivered and where it sits on the spectrum. While the combination of red and blue light therapies is widely understood in skincare, the lack of clear irradiance figures means serious tech-methodical buyers may want more data. (<a href="https://drdennisgross.com/products/drx-spectralite-faceware-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drdennisgross.com</a>)</p>
      <p>The rigid design also means some users with particular face shapes may find the mask less comfortable or may need to adjust straps frequently to keep it in place. If fit and adaptability are priorities, a softer silicone mask might be more comfortable in long use.</p>
      <h3>Who this makes sense for</h3>
      <p>This mask makes good sense for someone who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wants <strong>very short, structured sessions</strong> they can fit into a daily routine easily.</li>
        <li>Likes the idea of treating <strong>both acne and signs of aging</strong> with one device.</li>
        <li>Prefers a simple control scheme and automatic shut-off over more fiddly options.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is less ideal for someone who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wants <strong>high transparency on output and irradiance</strong> data.</li>
        <li>Needs a mask that <strong>moulds closely to every face shape</strong>.</li>
        <li>Plans on long treatments with custom control over intensity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Therabody TheraFace Mask</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $549 to $599</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want an all-in-one, guided treatment that combines red, infrared, and blue light with built-in vibration for a more "spa-like" session.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> It is heavier and more rigid than flexible masks, and you are paying for the experience and extra features rather than raw output transparency.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>The TheraFace Mask is designed to feel like more than just an LED mask. It runs through red, near-infrared, and blue light in a single, preset routine and adds gentle vibration, which makes sessions feel closer to a short facial treatment than a simple light exposure. The upside is convenience and structure. The downside is that it is bulkier, more expensive, and less focused on technical detail than simpler LED masks.</p>
      <p>If you want something that feels guided, hands-off, and a bit indulgent, this is one of the few masks that actually delivers that experience.</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h3>
      <p>This is a rigid shell mask rather than a flexible silicone one. That gives it a solid, premium feel and fairly even coverage across the face, including the cheeks, forehead, and chin. It also means it does not adapt to face shape as naturally as softer masks.</p>
      <p>For most people, the fit is secure and stable once strapped on, but some will notice pressure points or small gaps depending on face shape. The added weight from the vibration hardware makes it feel more substantial than simpler masks, which is fine for short sessions but not something you forget you are wearing.</p>
      <p>Coverage is generally good across the main facial zones, and the full-mask design makes it hard to miss areas.</p>
      <h3>Routine and usability</h3>
      <p>This is where the TheraFace Mask stands out.</p>
      <p>Sessions are fully preset at around nine minutes and run automatically through different light modes. You do not need to choose wavelengths, set timers, or manage sequences. You put it on, start it, and it turns itself off when the routine finishes.</p>
      <p>The vibration feature adds a gentle massage sensation around the face and temples. Some people will love this because it makes the session feel more relaxing and intentional. Others will see it as a nice extra rather than a core benefit. Either way, it clearly sets this mask apart from simpler LED-only designs.</p>
