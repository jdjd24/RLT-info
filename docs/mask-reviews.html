      <h2>CurrentBody Series 2 LED Mask review</h2>
      <p><strong>A thoughtful upgrade that focuses on fit, coverage and the wavelengths that actually matter</strong></p>
      <p>The market for at-home LED face masks is crowded and, frankly, a bit noisy. Most products promise dramatic results, quote selective bits of science and then rely on habit and hope to do the rest. The CurrentBody Series 2 takes a quieter approach. It does not try to reinvent LED therapy. Instead, it refines the parts that usually decide whether a device gets used or ends up in a drawer.</p>
      <p>If you have ever owned a mask that felt impressive for a week and then slowly disappeared from your routine, this one feels designed to avoid that fate.</p>
      <h3>What it actually does</h3>
      <p>At its core, this is a red and near-infrared LED mask built around <strong>633 nm</strong> and <strong>830 nm</strong>. Those are not fashionable choices. They are simply the wavelengths with the longest and most consistent track record in human skin studies.</p>
      <p>Over the past couple of decades, these bands have been studied for things like improving skin texture, softening fine lines, helping with post-procedure healing and reducing inflammation and redness. The effects are not miraculous and they are not instant, but there is enough clinical work behind them to say they are sensible choices rather than marketing inventions.</p>
      <p>Series 2 also adds a third wavelength, <strong>1072 nm</strong>, placed around the eyes and mouth. The evidence here is thinner, but promising enough to make this a reasonable bonus rather than a gimmick. It is best thought of as an extra layer, not the main reason to buy the mask.</p>
      <h3>What's actually new, and why it matters</h3>
      <p><strong>Better coverage under the chin</strong><br />Most flexible masks stop at the jawline. This one does not. The added chin strap means the under-chin and jaw area finally get direct light, which is relevant both for skin firmness and for people who tend to get breakouts along that line.</p>
      <p><strong>A softer, better-fitting shell</strong><br />The switch to poured silicone sounds like a technical detail, but it shows up in comfort. The mask sits more naturally on the face and is less prone to digging in around the nose or cheeks. Comfort matters, because comfort is what makes people keep using these things.</p>
      <p><strong>More attention to LED quality and verification</strong><br />CurrentBody has tightened the tolerance around the wavelengths and added a traceability system that lets you check what the device is supposed to be delivering. In a category where specs are often vague or selectively presented, this kind of transparency is genuinely welcome.</p>
      <p><strong>A redesigned battery</strong><br />The battery is now integrated and clips onto clothing. You get roughly ten sessions per charge. The downside is that the mask no longer lies completely flat, which makes storage and travel a little less tidy.</p>
      <h3>What using it is like</h3>
      <p>There is no app, no pulsing modes and no menu of settings. You put it on, run a ten-minute session and take it off. For many people, that simplicity will be a relief. For others, it may feel a bit bare-bones.</p>
      <p>The reported power level, around <strong>30 mW/cm2</strong>, is in line with other masks aimed at skin rather than deep tissue. That means you should think in terms of gradual, cumulative changes over weeks and months, not dramatic shifts in a few days.</p>
      <p>It is also a bright mask. If you are sensitive to light, you will probably want to use the optional eye inserts. They reduce the brightness, though they do not block it completely.</p>
      <h3>The small frustrations</h3>
      <p>The mask does not store as neatly as flatter designs, because of the battery shape. If you like to keep things tucked away in a slim drawer or pack light when travelling, you will notice this.</p>
      <p>Forehead coverage is fine, but not generous. That is true of most flexible masks, but if you have a larger forehead, you may wish it reached a little higher.</p>
      <h3>Who it makes sense for</h3>
      <p>This is a good choice if you want a <strong>well-built, evidence-aligned</strong> LED mask that is comfortable enough to use regularly and covers more of the face and jawline than most alternatives.</p>
      <p>It is less ideal if you want smart features, guided sessions, or something that packs completely flat.</p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>The CurrentBody Series 2 does not promise miracles, and that is part of its appeal. It keeps the wavelengths that make sense, improves the fit and coverage in ways that actually affect day-to-day use, and adds a level of quality control that is rare in this category.</p>
      <p>If you are looking for a premium LED mask that feels thoughtfully designed rather than over-marketed, this is one of the stronger options available right now.</p>

      <h2>Omnilux Contour Face</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $395-$450</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want a comfortable, simple mask they can use consistently without overthinking specs.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> Output and wavelength details are thin, so you are buying usability more than data transparency.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>This is a comfort-first mask that focuses on making daily use easy rather than chasing headline specs. The flexible fit and predictable 10-minute sessions make it one of the easier masks to live with long term. It is priced in the middle of the category and feels fair if your priority is routine adherence rather than technical detail. The trade-off is limited transparency around output and wavelengths.</p>
      <h3>What it is trying to do</h3>
      <p>The Contour Face is aimed at general skin quality and anti-ageing routines using red and near-infrared light. It does not try to be a multi-mode, multi-problem device. Instead, it focuses on delivering a simple, repeatable routine with a comfortable fit.</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h3>
      <p>The flexible silicone design sits comfortably on the face and holds its position well. Coverage is good across the main facial areas, and pressure points are minimal. This is one of its strongest points: it is easy to forget you are wearing it after a minute or two.</p>
      <h3>Routine and usability</h3>
      <p>Sessions run at about 10 minutes, and the controls are straightforward. There is no complexity here, which is exactly the appeal. You are unlikely to skip sessions because it feels like a hassle.</p>
      <h3>Light modes and what they are for</h3>
      <p>This is a red and near-infrared mask aimed at general skin tone and texture rather than acne-specific routines. There is no blue mode and no complex program selection, which keeps things simple but limits versatility.</p>
      <h3>What you get for the money</h3>
      <p>At around $395-$450, this sits in a reasonable middle ground. You are paying for comfort, fit, and ease of use rather than extra wavelengths or advanced controls. If you value a mask you will actually use, the price makes sense. If you want maximum technical features, other options offer more on paper.</p>
      <h3>Fine print</h3>
      <p>Marketed as FDA cleared. Like most masks in this category, detailed irradiance-at-skin data is not published.</p>

      <h2>DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro (Dr Dennis Gross)</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $455</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want very short, structured sessions and both red and blue light in one device.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> The fit is rigid, and output transparency is limited.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>The big appeal here is time: sessions are extremely short, which makes this one of the easiest masks to turn into a daily habit. The combination of red and blue light is useful if you are balancing skin ageing and breakouts. At around $455, it is not cheap, but the low time commitment is a real practical advantage. The downsides are a rigid shell and the usual lack of clear dose-at-skin data.</p>
      <h3>What it is trying to do</h3>
      <p>This mask combines red light for general skin quality and blue light for acne-prone skin, packaged into very short, automated sessions. It is positioned as a structured, no-thinking-required routine device rather than a customizable tool.</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h3>
      <p>The rigid shell does not adapt to face shape as well as flexible silicone masks, which can lead to small gaps or pressure points for some users. Coverage is still good across the main facial areas, but comfort is more "acceptable" than "forget you are wearing it".</p>
      <h3>Routine and usability</h3>
      <p>This is where it shines. Sessions are around three minutes with automatic shutoff, which removes almost all friction from daily use. Controls are simple, and there is very little setup each time.</p>
      <h3>Light modes and what they are for</h3>
      <p>You get red light for skin tone and texture and blue light for acne-focused routines. This makes it more versatile than red-only masks, especially for people dealing with breakouts alongside anti-ageing goals.</p>
      <h3>What you get for the money</h3>
      <p>At about $455, you are paying for convenience and dual-mode capability rather than comfort or data transparency. If time is your main barrier to consistency, the value proposition is strong. If comfort and fit matter more, other masks do better.</p>
      <h3>Fine print</h3>
      <p>Marketed as FDA cleared. No published irradiance or uniformity maps, which makes precise dose comparisons difficult.</p>

    <section class="section article-prose" id="mask-theraface">
      <h2>TheraFace Mask (Therabody)</h2>
      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $599-$699</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want an all-in-one face device combining LED with vibration and massage.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> You are paying for features more than better light performance.</p>
      <h3>Short verdict</h3>
      <p>This is the most feature-heavy mask in the group, combining LED light with vibration and other modalities. If you like the idea of a single device doing multiple things, the price can make sense. If your goal is purely LED therapy, it is hard to justify the premium, because the extra features do not clearly translate into better light delivery. Think of this as a skincare gadget first and a light device second.</p>
      <h3>What it is trying to do</h3>
      <p>The TheraFace Mask aims to be a multi-purpose facial treatment tool, mixing red, near-infrared, and blue light with vibration and massage features. It is designed for people who want a broader "treatment experience" rather than a single-purpose LED routine.</p>
      <h3>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h3>
      <p>The rigid shell and added hardware make it heavier than silicone masks. Fit is decent, but you are more aware you are wearing it, especially during longer or multi-mode sessions. Coverage across the face is still good.</p>
      <h3>Routine and usability</h3>
      <p>There are more modes and options here, which means more button-pressing and more decisions before each session. That is fine if you enjoy tinkering, but it is less "throw it on and go" than simpler masks.</p>
      <h3>Light modes and what they are for</h3>
      <p>You get red, near-infrared, and blue modes, covering both general skin quality and acne-focused use. The vibration and massage features are about comfort and experience rather than proven improvements in light therapy outcomes.</p>
      <h3>What you get for the money</h3>
      <p>At $599-$699, this is one of the most expensive options in the category. The price makes sense if you want an all-in-one facial device. If you are mainly buying it for LED therapy, you are paying extra for features that do not clearly improve light results.</p>
      <h3>Fine print</h3>
      <p>An FDA listing exists. As with most masks, there is no detailed irradiance-at-skin data published.</p>
