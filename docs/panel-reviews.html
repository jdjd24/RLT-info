      <h2>MitoPRO 1500+</h2>
      <p><strong>The rare panel that gets the basics right without overcomplicating things</strong></p>
      <p>The MitoPRO 1500+ sits in a sweet spot that's surprisingly hard to hit in this category. It's big enough that full-body sessions feel realistic rather than theoretical, powerful enough that you're not standing there forever, and priced in a way that doesn't make you feel like you're paying a "tech lifestyle" tax.</p>
      <p>In day-to-day use, what stands out is how straightforward it is. There's no app to fight with, no maze of modes to remember, and no sense that you're paying for features you'll stop using after the first week. You turn it on, you stand in front of it, you're done. That simplicity makes it much easier to stick with over months, which is where any red light setup either proves its worth or quietly gathers dust.</p>
      <p>The width and height put it into what most people would call "mostly full-body" territory. You'll still reposition for complete coverage, but not nearly as much as with narrower panels. For many home setups, this is about the largest single panel you can fit without turning a room into a clinic.</p>
      <p>Value is where the MitoPRO 1500+ really makes its case. At around $1,169, you're getting a lot of physical coverage for the money, and that matters more than small differences in headline output numbers. There are more powerful panels, and there are prettier ones, but few that make this much practical sense per dollar spent.</p>
      <p>The main caveat is the same one that applies to most of this category: you're relying on manufacturer-provided output data rather than independent, full-field measurements. In real-world terms, that's unlikely to be a deal-breaker, but it's worth keeping expectations grounded. This is a workhorse panel, not a lab instrument.</p>
      <p>If you want one panel that can realistically anchor a home setup without turning into a project in itself, this is one of the easiest to recommend.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want one big, no-nonsense panel that makes full-body routines practical at home.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> It's physically large, and like most panels, output figures are based on manufacturer testing rather than independent mapping.</p>

      <h2>Block Blue Light Mega 5.0</h2>
      <p><strong>High output, sensible spectrum, and unusually strong buyer protection</strong></p>
      <p>The Mega 5.0 is a very easy panel to recommend. It combines three things that matter in real use: a broad, practical spectrum, genuinely high output, and some of the best warranty and return terms in this part of the market. It does not try to be exotic or experimental. It tries to be a strong, reliable default for anyone who wants a serious wall panel without taking unnecessary risks.</p>
      <p>Spectrum-wise, this is a well-judged, general-purpose design: <strong>630 nm and 660 nm</strong> in the red range, plus near-infrared spread across <strong>810 nm, the low-830s, and 850 nm</strong>. That covers the wavelengths most people actually use for skin, joints, muscle, and general recovery work. The benefit of this approach is flexibility. You are not locking yourself into one narrow use case or one fashionable wavelength. For most buyers, that makes the panel more useful over the long term, not less.</p>
      <p>Output is one of the Mega’s strongest points. By wall-panel standards, it sits firmly in the <strong>high-power tier</strong>. In practical terms, that means shorter sessions, more comfortable working distances, and more room to fine-tune intensity using dimming instead of being forced into one “all or nothing” setting. This is exactly what you want if you plan to use the panel regularly and adjust exposure based on how your body responds.</p>
      <p>The control setup is also better than average. You get a <strong>built-in touchscreen</strong> with timer, dimming, and pulsing, plus a <strong>remote</strong> for simple operation. This covers everything most people actually need day to day, without forcing you into external apps or complicated setups. It is straightforward to set up, easy to change settings, and easy to live with.</p>
      <p>Where Block Blue Light really differentiates itself is on the purchase side. A <strong>three-year warranty</strong> and <strong>thirty-day return window</strong> are unusually generous in this category, and the company ships from <strong>the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand</strong>. That reduces both financial risk and logistical friction. For a product in this price range, that peace of mind is not a small thing.</p>
      <p>No product is perfect, and the compromises here are mostly about ecosystem rather than performance. There is <strong>no app</strong>, and if you want to run multiple panels as a tightly synced system, this is not the most elegant solution. For a single-panel setup, that is rarely an issue. For larger walls, it is something to think about. There is also the question of wavelength weighting: if your main goal is to heavily emphasize <strong>810 nm</strong>, some other panels allocate more of their output there. The Mega’s approach is broader and more balanced.</p>
      <p>Price-wise, this usually lands <strong>around the middle of the market</strong>, often just under <strong>$1,300 with discounts</strong>. Given the output level, feature set, and especially the warranty and return terms, it represents very solid value.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone who wants a powerful, flexible, full-body wall panel from a company with strong support and low purchase risk.</p>
      <p><strong>Worth considering alternatives if:</strong> You are building a large multi-panel setup and want unified app control, or you specifically want a panel heavily weighted toward 810 nm.</p>

      <h2>Hooga PRO1500</h2>
      <p><strong>A straightforward panel that focuses on the basics and little else</strong></p>
      <p>The Hooga PRO1500 feels deliberately uncomplicated. It's built around a simple idea: deliver a decent amount of light, tell you what that looks like at real distances, and don't bury the user in features they'll never touch. In a market that often confuses complexity with quality, that's a quietly sensible approach.</p>
      <p>In use, the first thing you notice is the narrower shape compared with wider panels in this class. That means you'll spend a bit more time repositioning to cover larger areas, especially if you're aiming for something close to full-body sessions. The flip side is that it's easier to place in a room and a little less imposing than some of the wider, heavier units.</p>
      <p>The controls are basic and the experience is utilitarian. There's nothing here that feels luxurious, but nothing that feels flimsy either. It does what it says on the box, and it does it in a predictable way. For a lot of people, that's exactly what you want from a device you plan to use several times a week.</p>
      <p>At around $1,199, the pricing feels fair for the size and output you're getting. You're not paying for a big ecosystem, an app, or a long list of modes. You're paying for a solid, mid-market panel that covers the essentials and stays out of your way.</p>
      <p>If you want something dependable and easy to understand, and you don't mind spending a bit more time repositioning during sessions, the PRO1500 fits that brief well.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want clear, no-nonsense performance claims and simple, repeatable daily use.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Narrower coverage means more repositioning, and it's light on extra features.</p>

      <h2>Rojo Refine 900</h2>
      <p><strong>A flexible, feature-forward panel for people who like to fine-tune their sessions</strong></p>
      <p>The Refine 900 takes a different approach from most panels in this size and price range. Instead of chasing the highest output numbers, it leans into flexibility. You get more modes, more programs, and more ways to shape a session around what you feel like doing that day. If you enjoy that sense of control, this panel is easy to like.</p>
      <p>Living with it, the interface and feature set are the main draw. Pulsing modes, smart programs, and custom options give it a more "modern device" feel than some of the more utilitarian slabs of LEDs in this category. It feels designed for people who want to engage with their setup rather than just switch it on and step in front of it.</p>
      <p>The trade-off is time. Reported output is lower than several competitors, which means sessions tend to run longer if you're aiming for the same dose. For some people, that's fine. For others, it becomes the quiet reason the panel gets used less often than planned.</p>
      <p>At under $1,200, the price makes sense if you actually value the feature set. You're getting a lot of control for the money. But if your main goal is to get the most light in the shortest time, you'll likely find better value elsewhere.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who enjoy tweaking settings, using different modes, and customizing their sessions.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Lower output means longer sessions compared with higher-power panels.</p>

      <h2>PlatinumLED BioMax Pro Ultra</h2>
      <p><strong>The high-output option for people who care more about intensity than polish</strong></p>
      <p>The BioMax Pro Ultra is built around one clear idea: deliver a lot of light. If your priority is shorter sessions, more comfortable treatment from a bit further back, or simply knowing you're using one of the stronger panels in this size class, this is where your money goes.</p>
      <p>In practice, that focus shows. The panel feels more like industrial equipment than a lifestyle product. The interface is functional rather than elegant, and the overall experience is more "tool" than "gadget." That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean you're not paying for comfort or clever UX. You're paying for output.</p>
      <p>At around $1,500 and up, this is one of the most expensive options in the group, and value here is very conditional. If you actually need or want that extra intensity, the price can be justified. If you don't, it's hard to ignore how much of the premium is tied up in performance you may never fully use.</p>
      <p>There are also some practical ownership considerations. The unit is big and heavy, and the return policy is stricter than several competitors. This isn't a casual, try-it-and-see purchase. It makes the most sense when you're already confident about what you want and why you want it.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who prioritize high output and want to keep session times shorter or treat from further away.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> High price, more utilitarian user experience, and a less forgiving return policy.</p>

      <h2>Rouge G4</h2>
      <p><strong>A spectrum-and-settings playground that trades speed for control</strong></p>
      <p>The Rouge G4 is built for people who like to tinker. It puts a lot of emphasis on wavelength variety, smart modes, and session customization, and if you enjoy dialing in different setups rather than running the same routine every time, this panel gives you plenty to play with.</p>
      <p>In day-to-day use, that flexibility is the main attraction. You're not locked into a single way of using it, and the interface encourages experimentation. It feels more like a configurable device than a fixed appliance, which will appeal to a certain type of user.</p>
      <p>The cost of that approach is time. Reported output is lower than most of the other panels in this group, so reaching the same dose usually means longer sessions. If you have the patience for that, it's not a problem. If you're trying to squeeze sessions into a busy schedule, it can quickly become one.</p>
      <p>At just over $1,300, it's not cheap, so the value really depends on whether those extra options are something you'll actually use. If you just want efficient, no-nonsense light delivery, there are better buys. If you want control and variety, this is one of the more interesting options.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who prioritize wavelength variety and enjoy customizing their sessions.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Lower output means longer sessions, despite a premium price.</p>

    <section class="section article-prose" id="panel-joovv">
      <h2>Joovv Solo 3.0</h2>
      <p><strong>A beautifully designed entry point into an expensive ecosystem</strong></p>
      <p>The Joovv Solo 3.0 feels more like a piece of premium consumer tech than a piece of therapy equipment. The build quality is excellent, the software experience is slick, and the whole system is clearly designed to grow with you if you start adding more panels. In terms of fit, finish, and overall polish, it's one of the nicest products in this category.</p>
      <p>Using it day to day, the app-based control is genuinely convenient. Timers, routines, and intensity adjustments are easy to manage, and it makes the whole experience feel more structured and "guided" than most bare-bones panels. If you like the idea of your device nudging you into consistency, Joovv does this better than almost anyone else.</p>
      <p>The problem is value per square inch. At around $1,699 for a relatively narrow panel, you're paying a premium for the ecosystem, the design, and the software layer, not for raw coverage or output. On its own, it's hard to justify purely as a light-delivery tool. You'll spend more time repositioning than with wider panels that cost less, and sessions don't feel especially fast.</p>
      <p>Where it does make sense is as a starting point. If you already know you want to build a modular, multi-panel setup over time and you care about having everything integrated and app-controlled, the Solo 3.0 is a clean, well-executed way to begin. If you just want the most light for your money today, it's one of the weakest value propositions in this group.</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want app control and plan to expand into a multi-panel Joovv system.</p>
      <p><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Very expensive for the coverage you get if you're only buying a single panel.</p>
