      <h1>Therabody TheraFace Mask</h1>

      <p><strong>Price snapshot:</strong> $549 to $599</p>
      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want an all-in-one, guided treatment that combines red, infrared, and blue light with built-in vibration for a more "spa-like" session.</p>
      <p><strong>What to know before buying:</strong> It is heavier and more rigid than flexible masks, and you are paying for the experience and extra features rather than raw output transparency.</p>

      <h2>Short verdict</h2>
      <p>The TheraFace Mask is designed to feel like more than just an LED mask. It runs through red, near-infrared, and blue light in a single, preset routine and adds gentle vibration, which makes sessions feel closer to a short facial treatment than a simple light exposure. The upside is convenience and structure. The downside is that it is bulkier, more expensive, and less focused on technical detail than simpler LED masks.</p>
      <p>If you want something that feels guided, hands-off, and a bit indulgent, this is one of the few masks that actually delivers that experience.</p>

      <h2>Fit, comfort, and coverage</h2>
      <p>This is a rigid shell mask rather than a flexible silicone one. That gives it a solid, premium feel and fairly even coverage across the face, including the cheeks, forehead, and chin. It also means it does not adapt to face shape as naturally as softer masks.</p>
      <p>For most people, the fit is secure and stable once strapped on, but some will notice pressure points or small gaps depending on face shape. The added weight from the vibration hardware makes it feel more substantial than simpler masks, which is fine for short sessions but not something you forget you are wearing.</p>
      <p>Coverage is generally good across the main facial zones, and the full-mask design makes it hard to miss areas.</p>

      <h2>Routine and usability</h2>
      <p>This is where the TheraFace Mask stands out.</p>
      <p>Sessions are fully preset at around nine minutes and run automatically through different light modes. You do not need to choose wavelengths, set timers, or manage sequences. You put it on, start it, and it turns itself off when the routine finishes.</p>
      <p>The vibration feature adds a gentle massage sensation around the face and temples. Some people will love this because it makes the session feel more relaxing and intentional. Others will see it as a nice extra rather than a core benefit. Either way, it clearly sets this mask apart from simpler LED-only designs.</p>
